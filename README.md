# Better Backlight

Better Backlight aims to improve the keyboard backlight control on Linux systems. 

It automatically disables the keyboard backlight after a period of inactivity and restores it when the user interacts with the keyboard.

It respects user preferences. If the user disabled the keyboard backlight, Better Backlight will not enable it automatically.
If the user set a specific brightness level, Better Backlight will not go beyond that level.

## Features

- Automatic keyboard backlight control.
- Automatic detection of supported backlit keyboard devices.
